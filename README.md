*Master the clock. Conquer the combat.*

Horatum is an addon that records every boss combat encounter and saves the fastest victory.

The following key features are currently implemented:
*   **Combat Time Tracker** - During a boss combat, a small window will appear displaying the current combat time and other information.
*   (Planned) **Combat Time Overview** - All boss combat times can be displayed in an overview window.

### Features

*   The timer triggers the moment you engage a dungeon or raid boss and stops the exact second the combat ends or your group wipes.
*	Saves your fastest victory times, organized by boss name and encounter difficulty.
*   Features a clean, semi-transparent frame that displays the ongoing combat time.
*	After an combat concludes, the timer stops and remains on your screen, allowing you to easily review the exact duration of your attempt.
*	Customizable UI:
	*	Drag and place the Combat Time Tracker anywhere on your screen.
	*	The size of the Combat Time Tracker can be easily adjusted to fit your interface needs.
*   Supported Languages: English, German
*   Supported Versions: 'Classic', 'Burning Crusade - Classic Anniversary Edition', 'Mists of Pandaria - Classic' and 'Retail'
