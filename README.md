*Measure your battles. Master the time.*

Horatum is an addon that tracks the duration of boss encounters and keeps a history of your fastest kills.

### Features

*   Automatic Boss Tracking: The timer automatically starts the moment you engage a dungeon or raid boss and stops the exact second the fight ends or your group wipes.
*	Best Time Records: Automatically saves your fastest kill time, specifically categorized by each boss and encounter difficulty.
*   Live Timer Display: Features a clean, semi-transparent frame that displays the ongoing combat time.
*	Persistent Results: After an encounter concludes, the timer stops and remains on your screen, allowing you to easily review the exact duration of your attempt.
*   Freely Movable: The timer frame can be dragged and placed anywhere on your screen to perfectly fit your UI.
*   Supported Languages: English, German
*   Supported Versions: 'Classic', 'Burning Crusade - Classic Anniversary Edition', 'Mists of Pandaria - Classic' and 'Retail'
